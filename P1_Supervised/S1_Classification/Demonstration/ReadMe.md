# Introduction
In this demonstration we will working with the image digit recognition problem
## Problem statement:
-   Digit recognition:
    -   The digit recognition problem refers to the task of recognizing and classifying handwritten or printed digits into their corresponding numerical values. In particular, it commonly involves recognizing digits from 0 to 9.
    -   In this demonstration we will try to classify image of digit (8x8 pixel in grayscale) into 10 predefined classes (0-9).
## Motivation:
Digit Recognition is essential for interpreting image processing and pattern recognition. This problem has various applications, including:
-   Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Digit recognition is a fundamental component of OCR systems, which convert scanned or photographed text documents into machine-readable text.

-   Automated Document Processing: In industries like finance and banking, digit recognition is used to process checks, invoices, and forms automatically.

-   Postal Services: Digit recognition can help in reading postal codes and sorting mail automatically.

-   Human-Computer Interaction: It can be used in touchscreens, stylus input, or any application where handwritten digits need to be interpreted.

-   CAPTCHA Solving: In some cases, automated systems may need to solve CAPTCHAs, which often include recognizing distorted or handwritten digits.

Machine learning and computer vision techniques are commonly used to address the digit recognition problem. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are popular for this task because they are effective at capturing local patterns in images, making them well-suited for recognizing handwritten or printed digits. Additionally, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide tools and libraries for training and deploying digit recognition models.
