-   In my opinion, the whole knowledge (content of this coure) is too large for only one coures.
    -   I think it may be too much for most student can follow the whole content in one coure.
    -   Many school separate this into three courses:
        -   Introduction to AI (Traditional method (Search,...), Python, Pandas,...)
        -   Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised), Preprocessing data, Solve by probability, KNN, SVM, Decesion Tree,...
        -   Deep Learning (Perceptron Network, Neural Network, Convolution Neural Network)
