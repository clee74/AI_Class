# Introduction
In this demonstation we will be working with a psudo dataset of point in 2 dimensional (two features).
-   When we generate a psudo dataset, we may have label of each data point, but we may assumed that we don't have label of any point (unsupervised learning: model only touch the features without label (output))
## Problem:
Divide point into similar clusters base on similarities.
## Demo code:
-   Hierachical
-   K-means
-   DBSCAN
-   Meanshift: <https://analyticsindiamag.com/hands-on-tutorial-on-mean-shift-clustering-algorithm/>(Mean shift)
