# Slide Supervised learning -- Numerical problems - What is time series? Data type and pre-processing
-   Sequences come in various forms, and this content focuses on time series. More simple, a time series is a sequence in which changes in the data sequence are related to time, and the order of observation values cannot be changed arbitrarily, which is called time series data. For example: data in the past time will inveitably have an impact on data in the future, which means that data at different points in time are relevant.

-   Autoregression and autocorrelation analysis.
# Slide Stationary and Non-Stationary
-   To some time series to be classified as stationary (covariance stationarity), it must satisfy 3 conditions:
    -   Constant mean
    -   Constant variance
    -   Constant covariance between periods of identical distance
